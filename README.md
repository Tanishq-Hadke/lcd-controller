# LCD Interface – FPGA Design using Vivado

This repository contains the design and implementation of an **LCD interface** using **Verilog HDL** in **Xilinx Vivado**.  
The project demonstrates how to interface a standard **16x2 character LCD (HD44780 compatible)** with an FPGA.

## 📌 Overview

Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) are commonly used in embedded systems for displaying text and system status.  
This design focuses on interfacing a 16x2 LCD in **4-bit mode**, which reduces the number of required data pins while maintaining reliable communication.

The LCD is controlled using command and data instructions generated by the FPGA.

## 🔌 LCD Signals

| Signal | Direction | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| clk  | Input  | System clock |
| rst  | Input  | Active-high reset |
| rs   | Output | Register Select (0: Command, 1: Data) |
| rw   | Output | Read/Write control (0: Write) |
| en   | Output | Enable signal |
| data[3:0] | Output | LCD data lines (4-bit mode) |

## 📐 LCD Operation

- **RS = 0** → Command register  
- **RS = 1** → Data register  
- **RW = 0** → Write operation  
- **EN** → Triggers data/command latch on high-to-low transition  

The LCD is initialized following the HD44780 timing requirements before displaying characters.
